Future Iterations and Versions:
V2: Add styling so that it looks more sleak and clean.
I want to go for a sharp and futuristic theme that looks very 'high-tech'.
I also want to be able to hide the edit, up till the point that the user clicks
the edit button and it displays. However, I need to come up with a format that
looks really good on a table format such as the one I have. I think it would be
nice to be able to edit directly on the table instead of having a form.
    Insert functionality to allow users to insert profile pictures.

V3: Add Geolocation. This is an essential part of the end goal and without it,
the objective for Gridleaves is not fully complete. When Gridleaves becomes a
location-based application, it will be possibly to view how everyone in one's
surroundings can contribute to improving the community. Gridleaves will no longer
be just some database filled with the information of random users, but rather users
who live within one mile from the user and who the user can contact if needed.

V4: Add Stylistic Maps displaying the relative location of individuals on Gridleaves
to the user. It could possibly track both of the users location to allow them to view
when they are close to each other or where they are located within the community. This
raises some privacy and safety concerns but I think the pros could possibly outweight
the cons especially if strict measures are put in place to keep everyone safe.


Plannings:

I began with User Authentication
Continued with Adding a Create Profile Feature
I styled and Created a Table using HTML where I could display the newly created Profile.
Write a Handlebars template so that a new row is added to the table each time a profile is created.
Implemented Get All/Index functionality
Implemented Add new Profile functionality
Implemented Update functionality
Implememted Delete functionality
Updated the User Experience to display messages to guide the User.

User Stories:
```
As a user, I expect there to be a sign-up and sign-in page.
As a user, once I sign up, I expect to be able to sign-in.
As a user, I expect to be able to fill out a profile immediately so that is can be displayed in the database.
As a user, I expect that there are forms I need to fill to create my profile.
As a user, I expect, that once I finish my profile, I will be able to see it on the database.
As a user, I expect to be able to see the profiles of anyone else who has created one.
As a user, I expect to be able to delete my own profile if I need to.
As a user, I expect to be able to update my profile.
As a user, I expect to be able to create a second profile, in case I want to present myself in two different ways. I expect to be able to create as many profiles as I need to in order to convey myself to the public.
As a user, I expect to be able to log-out and change my password.
